# IOT_Task2_Interface

I designed an interface that controls the movement of the robot base, and then I combined it with the robotic arm movement interface.

**This repository contains several files...**

**index.php**: contains **HTML** and **PHP** code to connect the interface with the database.

**style.css**: contains **CSS** code for page appearance.

**directionValue.php**: contains **PHP** code to retrieve direction value from the database.

**robot_arm Database.sql**: contains the database.

- It also contains a picture of the interface and a video showing how it works.
